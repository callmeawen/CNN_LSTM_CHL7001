# Stock-Price-Prediction
Predicting stock price using historical data of a company, using Neural networks (LSTM).

This project includes python programs to show Keras LSTM can be used to predict future stock prices for a company using it's
historical stock price data. 
You can also find sample programs on how to fine tune Hyperprameters of LSTM (or any Neural Network for that matter).

If you are further interested in the project, checkout my blog on the same [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/predicting-stock-price-with-lstm-13af86a74944)

Here is the final result : (although performance could be further improved to some extent by playing around with the parameters even more)
